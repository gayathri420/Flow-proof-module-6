# Crypto Dumps
This program operates on the Flow blockchain and involves creating an NFT, as well as implementing functions like depositing, borrowing, and withdrawing.

# Overview
The code is a smart contract written in Cadence, tailored for the Flow blockchain. It encompasses various functions that manipulate the blockchain's state through transactions. The program provides a basic yet comprehensive approach to creating an NFT and establishing functionalities and resources for interacting with and altering the NFT.

# Execution
To execute the program, utilize Flow Playground, an online Cadence IDE.

The code begins by importing the non-fungible token standard into the primary contract. Following project requirements, a "borrowauthnft" function is created. Additionally, an interface is established to incorporate specific functions accessible to the public. Finally, the transaction is deployed to retrieve the metadata stored within the NFT.
